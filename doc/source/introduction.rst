Introduction
============

BAMM (Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixtures)
uses reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo
to automatically detect subtrees that share common evolutionary parameters
of speciation, extinction, and phenotypic evolution.
BAMM assumes that phylogenetic trees are shaped
by a discrete number of evolutionary events.
For example, an event may be a change in speciation rate
or a change in the rate of body size evolution.
BAMM assumes that events occur across the branches
of a phylogenetic tree under a compound Poisson process.
